			<h2>UCLA Summer Research Program</h2>
			<p class="left-picture-description">
				In the summer of 2018, I completed an 8-week summer research program hosted at UCLA. Every student was assigned a different professor based on their major, who would in turn assign a research program to them. I was placed in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and my project was to build a website that could automatically grade embedded systems assignemnts. To do so, the website had to communicate with microcontrollers, which was a bit of a complicated task to achieve. The idea of the project wasn't so much to actually deploy a fully functioning website and was more of a proof of concept. We showed that the website could communicate with microcontrollers, run tests on them, and grade their output. To the left is a picture showing the setup required to do this. To learn more about it, visit the <a href="https://github.com/nesl/Autograder2.0" target="_blank">github</a> page.

			<h2>JPL NCAS</h2>
			<p class="left-picture-description">
				In September 2018, I was invited to participate in an on-site experience at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as part of NASA's National Community College Aerospace Scholars (NCAS) program. I got to tour JPL and enter a 4-day competition where we built Mars rovers in teams. My team won and I received an MVP award for my contributions as lead software engineer. On the left, you can see our victory picture.
