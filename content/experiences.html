					<h2>UCLA Summer Research Program</h2>
					<p>
						In the summer of 2018, I completed an 8-week summer research program hosted at UCLA. Every student was assigned a different professor based on their major, who would in turn assign a research program to them. I was placed in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and my project was to build a website that could automatically grade embedded systems assignemnts. To do so, the website had to communicate with microcontrollers, which was a bit of a complicated task to achieve. The idea of the project wasn't so much to actually deploy a fully functioning website and was more of a proof of concept. We showed that the website could communicate with microcontrollers, run tests on them, and grade their output. To the left is a picture showing the setup required to do this. To learn more about it, visit the <a href="https://github.com/nesl/Autograder2.0" target="_blank">github</a> page.

					<h2>JPL NCAS</h2>
					<p>
						In September 2018, I was invited to participate in an on-site experience at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as part of NASA's National Community College Aerospace Scholars (NCAS) program. I got to tour JPL and enter a 4-day competition where we built Mars rovers in teams. The mars rovers had to navigate an obstacle course and retrieve either rocks or "austronauts". It did so using different mechanical methods and sensors. My team won and I received an MVP award for my contributions as lead software engineer. On the left, you can see our victory picture.
