			<h2>TunnelMan</h2>
			<p class="left-picture-description">
				<em>TunnelMan</em> is a video game designed in C++ that I made for my Advanced C++ class. It is similar to the 80's arcade game Dig Dug, and features a man digging around earth to find oil barrels. Collect all the barrels, and you move on to the next level. There are a variety of power-ups to collect along the way to help you avoid the enemies, called <em>protesters</em>. This game was the final project for the class, and I was given a more than 50-page specification on how the game should play. I was also given a framework that was sort of a game engine to help me develop it. The framework handled a few of the low-level details, but I had to design almost everything else. I created all the classes for the on-screen objects, defined how user input affects the game, made it so the player could pick up items, created hitboxes, programmed the AI (which included implementing a shortest path maze algorithm so the enemies could follow the player if he was detected), among other things. Because our class got behind during the semester, we had 3 weeks to do this project instead of the usual 4, so unfortunately I had to rush some parts. Thankfully though, I managed to finish it. It plays exactly as the specification required it to and it's fully functional and playable. My portion ended up being more than 2,000 lines!
