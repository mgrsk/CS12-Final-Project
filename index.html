			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p class="left-picture-description">
				Hello, my name is Manuel Rivas. I am currently a computer science major at El Camino College, but I will be transferring in the fall of 2019 to a university. However, I am still awaiting admission letters, so I'm not sure which one I'll be going to. You could say I am a scientist at heart, as I have taken many science classes from a broad range of subjects, including physics, math, chemistry, and of course, computer science. Since I started studying computer science, I have participated in a few different computer science-related programs, including a summer research program at UCLA and a NASA competition where I coded a robot to victory! If you'd like to read more about those, check out my <a href="content/experiences.html">experiences</a> page. I've also done a few pretty cool projects, the source code of which is on my <a href="https://github.com/mgrsk" target="_blank">github</a>. I have a <a href="content/projects.html">projects</a> page on here which has overviews of those, too.

			<h2>About My School</h2>
			<p class="left-picture-description">
				El Camino College is a community college in Torrance that I've been attending since 2016. As I mentioned in my about me section, I've taken many computer science courses including C++, C++ Data Structures, Advanced C++, Java, Assembly, and Web Design. I am also the Treasurer for the El Camino College ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) chapter. My main job is to record transactions for the club, but I also do recruiting and event planning.
